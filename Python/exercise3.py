# Exercise 3: Slice list into 3 equal chunks and reverse each chunk
# Given:

# sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]

# Expected Outcome:

# Chunk  1 [11, 45, 8]
# After reversing it  [8, 45, 11]
# Chunk  2 [23, 14, 12]
# After reversing it  [12, 14, 23]
# Chunk  3 [78, 45, 89]
# After reversing it  [89, 45, 78]
